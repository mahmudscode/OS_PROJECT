# 🖥️ OS_PROJECT – Operating System Utilities in Python

**OS_PROJECT** is a Python-based Operating System project that demonstrates multiple OS-level concepts such as system monitoring, file handling, encryption, networking, USB detection, and algorithm implementation.  
Each Python file represents a separate OS utility module, and together they form a mini OS toolkit.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand how Python interacts with the Operating System
- Implement OS-related utilities using scripting
- Learn system monitoring, file operations, and hardware interaction
- Practice modular programming in Python
